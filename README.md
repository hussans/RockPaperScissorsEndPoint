**Project Name**: All For One API
<br/>
**Description**: The endpoint is a Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock game API where the player competes against the computer in a best-of-three format. The player inputs their choice for each round (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock), while the computer randomly selects its choice. The endpoint determines the winner of each round based on the game rules, keeps track of the scores, and declares the overall winner after three rounds. The response includes the player’s and computer’s choices for each round, the round results, and the final game outcome. Good luck!
